- Toreador
- Wanted [[Dante 'Goliath' Ravenwood (He)]] to turn [[Aurelio 'The Jackal' Faustini (He)]] into a vampire
- 'Wine buddies' with Aurelio
	- Same tastes
	- Aurelio is her favorite guest
	- Aurelio projects his imperfections onto her
	- She is the only one who is the same as when Aurelio was staked. He knows where he stands with her and as a result spends a good deal of time with her instead of other acquaintances or old friends. He doesn't neglect his work but at least at her parties, he is the same, the favorite guest. Here, he has been exposed to technology but refuses to learn anything about it, unable to handle one more thing he has no control over.
